# OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS

- Read the entire file and either add a new entry or amend an already existing entry for the date in question
- If an entry for the date in question already exists, consolidate the new user data with the existing user data for that day.
- If you get multiple information in one sentence, break them up in multiple bullet points. Reformulate items so that they make full sentences
- Throughout the entire document correct spelling and correct incorrect date formatting.
