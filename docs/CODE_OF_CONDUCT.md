# Code of Conduct

## Our Expectation

We expect all contributors and community members to act with basic human decency and common sense.

This project exists to help people augment their capabilities with AI, and we welcome contributions from anyone who shares this mission. We assume good faith and trust that everyone involved is here to build something valuable together.

## Guidelines

- **Be respectful**: Treat others as you'd want to be treated in a professional setting
- **Be constructive**: Focus on the work and help make the project better
- **Be collaborative**: We're all working toward the same goal - making Fabric more useful
- **Use good judgment**: If you're not sure whether something is appropriate, it probably isn't

## Reporting Issues

If someone is being genuinely disruptive or harmful, please email the maintainers directly. We'll address legitimate concerns promptly and fairly.

## Enforcement

Maintainers reserve the right to remove content and restrict access for anyone who consistently acts in bad faith or disrupts the community.

*This project assumes contributors are adults who can work together professionally. If you can't do that, this isn't the right place for you.*
